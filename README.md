# portfolio-card
This is a personal portfolio card project developed using pure HTML and CSS. It includes a profile section, skills display, and contact links, designed with a clean and minimal user interface. The project helped me understand HTML structure, CSS styling, alignment, spacing, and responsive design principles.
